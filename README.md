# Sentiment_Analyzer

This project contains everything needed to build a web app that accepts user input, extracts Yelp reviews for a given business, and outputs the breakdown of customer sentiment.

Please reference the ‘Final Project Part2.ipynb’ file to run the logistic regression and count vectorizer models.  This step is essential for the app.py program to work.  
The .ipynb file builds, trains, and saves the models required in the app.py file.
